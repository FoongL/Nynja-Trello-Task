# Foong Leung's FortNynja Trello card posting assignment

Welcome to my final submission for the exercise.
I hope you like my iteration of how the program should work!

## Installation

When you first copy this repository onto your machine, just remember to open up the folder and run the following yarn install in order to ensure all modules are working.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Hosting it on your local machine

From there it is rather simple, just run the following command for the program to be hosted on your local port 3000.

```bash
yarn start
```

### Visiting the online hosted
This project has also been hosted on surge, just a simple and quick way to get a front end application up and running for free on the web, the link can be found [Here](https://fort-trello.surge.sh/)

## Things to note
The list selection is defaulted to post into "To Do" list, however the freedom to select between list was provided for the user (i like giving freedom). However, if other lists were chosen, an alert would pop up to notify the user of said change.

## Notable Exclusion
I only included what i thought would be the most "important" qualities for a card, however one was skipped: adding members. This was chosen due to the fact that the Trello API would only return one user per board, who was usually the created. I had tested this with other boards in which the same result would occur, and for that reason, giving the option to include Members in cards was excluded. If it were to be included, a dropdown menu would be added much like how list and label selection was done.

## Parting thoughts
I hope you enjoyed my version of the card loader, and would greatly appreciate any feedback you may have to further improve!



Thank you
